WiseCash leverages the financial data you provide to forecast your business bank account balance and compute your runway. Here is how to build your forecast:

## Make an Inventory of your transactions

Before feeding any data into WiseCash, take a moment to make an inventory of the expenses and income that your business runs on. Useful data about this is can be found in:

* Upcoming payments from your revenue sources (consulting, products etc.).
* Upcoming planned taxes schedule.
* Your last bank receipts (especially useful to detect repeat transactions).
* Our list of [commonly found repeat transactions in a business](../common-expenses-and-income/).

## Enter your planned expenses and income

Using repeat transactions as often as possible (in order to reduce future updating work), enter your planned expenses and income using the entry form.

When in doubt, adopt a **conservative stance**: over-estimate expenses and under-estimate income.

Use the auto-mark-as-paid feature to reduce future updating work on your forecast.

  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Focus on the large transactions first. You will get a 95%-accurate forecast in limited time this way. Also, there is not much need to back-fill your past data. Instead, focus on getting upcoming transactions right.

## Forecast your cash-flow

Once the forecast data is ready, you can:

* Forecast your business bank-account balance (up to one year in advance).
* Track your yearly income goal (including planned & paid income transactions).
* Visualize a monthly-breakdown of profits, expenses and income.
* Zoom into a specific account to verify upcoming transactions.
