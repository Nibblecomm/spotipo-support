WiseCash provides you with a short-term dashboard, helpful to review overdue and 2-week upcoming transactions.

It helps you offload cognitive burden from your brain and focus on what matters to you (outside finances).

To reach the dashboard, simply click on the dashboard icon:

TODO: screenshot

This screen is useful to:

* Make sure you have invoiced your clients.
* Review which payments you should have received.
* Make sure you anticipate an upcoming payment or filing.

The dashboard acts as a convenient todo list after a long period not managing your finances, such as holidays, an illness or a long streak of work, or even before taking some time off.
