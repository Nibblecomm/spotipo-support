When a recurring series is already in place, you can modify one entry, if needed. Here is how to do that:

## Go to the Account Overview page

While it can be done from other screens in WiseCash, editing the data from the Account Overview page makes it easier to verify what you are doing.

## Select the Transaction To Be Modified

Click on the edit icon. The selected transaction should appear in blue and its data should be displayed in the entry form:

## Modify the Occurrence Information

Change the required data then click on Save:

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Changing the due date will "detach" the occurrence from its series. This means that future updates to the series as a whole won't impact this occurrence anymore.
</div>
