When a [recurring series, Setting up a Recurring Transaction] is in place, you may want to stop it.

If this is only temporary, you can **set the amount to zero** and save all upcoming occurrences.

If you want to stop the series for good, though, follow the steps below:

## Go to the [Account Overview] page

While it can be done from other screens in WiseCash, editing the data from the [Account Overview] page makes it easier to verify what you are doing.

## Select the first occurrence to be deleted

In the transactions list, click **edit** on the **first occurrence** that you want to delete.

It should appear in blue and the form should display the corresponding data.

## Click on Delete with future occurrences

You can hover the **Delete with future occurrences** button to get a preview of which transactions will be deleted, then click on the button to validate.
