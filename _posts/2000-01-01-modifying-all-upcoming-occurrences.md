When a [recurring series, Setting up a Recurring Transaction] is already in place, you can modify the amount and description for all the remaining occurrences of the series. Here is how to do that:

## Go to the Account Overview page

While it can be done from other screens in WiseCash, editing the data from the [Account Overview] page makes it easier to verify what you are doing:

{% include screenshot.html file="reaching-account-overview.png" %}

## Select the first occurrence to be modified

In the transactions list, click **edit** on the **first occurrence** that you want to modify.

It should appear in blue and the form should display the corresponding data.

## Modify the series information

Change the required data in the form, then hover the **Save with future occurrences** button. The impacted transactions will be marked in blue. Click the button to apply.
