If one of your income sources has a growth pattern, you can forecast it using the month-to-month growth feature in WiseCash.

This feature is also useful to do break-even analysis on one of your product, especially when coupled with [tagging and filtering,Applying Tagging & Filtering ].

To apply a monthly growth percentage, you must first create a [repeat transaction, Setting up a Recurring Transaction], then later update it to apply the growth simulation. Here is how to do this:

## Create a repeat transaction

Create a [repeat transaction, Setting up a Recurring Transaction] starting today, using the starting value for amount.

## Edit one occurrence

Go to the [Account Overview] then edit the occurrence from which you want to start projecting your growth.

## Fill the growth percent

TODO: screenshot

then click on **Save with future occurrences**.

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> For technical reasons, the growth only applies to the 2 upcoming years. Afterwards the last amount is applied indefinitely.
</div>

If you need to review and update your growth later, you can pick a transaction in the series and apply the same manipulation from there.
