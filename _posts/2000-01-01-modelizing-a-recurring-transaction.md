WiseCash helps you modelize repeat transactions (salaries, subscriptions, etc.) without having to labor over a spreadsheet. Here is how to create a repeat transaction in your forecast:

## Go to the Account Overview page

You can create repeat transactions from most pages in WiseCash, yet doing this from the Account Overview page makes it easier to verify your data entry.

## Enter Transaction Information And Create Transaction

Define the type of transaction (expense / income), pick a start date, an account and a repeat period, then click on Create:

You can later modify the amount for one or all upcoming transactions, or stop the series. It's also possible to simulate month-to-month growth.

TODO: mention that changing date is not yet possible.

TODO: link pages.
